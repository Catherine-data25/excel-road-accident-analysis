# excel-road-accident-analysis
An end-to-end analytics project covering data cleaning, descriptive stats, risk-factor analysis, actionable recommendations for road-safety stakeholders. Key elements: data standardisation (dates/time/locations), severity distribution, weekday/area patterns.To clean, analyse severity, identify high-risk factors and produce an interactive dashboard.

Objectives: clean & standardise, analyse severity/frequency, identify high-risk factors (speed limits, weather, road conditions), and produce an interactive dashboard + recommendations.

Findings:

Weekday pattern: Friday shows the highest accident frequency.

Rural vs urban severity: ~59% of fatal accidents occur in rural areas vs ~41% urban.
Severity mix: dataset dominated by Slight injuries, followed by Serious, then Fatal.

Recommendations: targeted speed-limit policies in hotspots, improved lighting/drainage & signage, and public awareness to mitigate human-factor risks. 

Deliverables: cleaned dataset, analysis notebooks, visual summary, and dashboard.
